# Stickier Note

## Description

Stickier Note is a native desktop application I built for my own use.
It is built using Electron and ReactJS. It is designed to be overlayed on top of other windows, allowing you to keep important notes visible while you work on other tasks.

## Features

- save the notes upon exit
- load the notes upon start
- resize and drag the notes around the screen
- change the color of the notes
- change the background color of the notes
